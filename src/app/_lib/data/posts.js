    <h2>Why Do We Need Metadata?</h2>
    
     <p>Adding metadata to your website is crucial for visibility and engagement. It helps search engines and social media accurately represent your content and enhances user experience. Optimizing your metadata can lead to increased traffic and a stronger online presence.</p>
    <p><strong>Title and Description:</strong> Specifying these helps search engines understand your page and display it properly in search results, influencing click-through rates.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Including relevant keywords helps improve your page's ranking for those terms.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Enhances Social Media Sharing</h3>
    <p><strong>Open Graph Tags:</strong> Used by platforms like Facebook to control how your page looks when shared—title, description, and image.</p>
    <p><strong>Twitter Cards:</strong> Similar to Open Graph tags but for Twitter, enabling rich media experiences when your page is shared.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Better User Experience</h3>
    <p><strong>Consistent Branding:</strong> Metadata ensures your brand is presented consistently across platforms, building recognition and trust.</p>
    <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Including image descriptions improves accessibility for users with disabilities.</p>

    <p>With the <code>dynamic()</code> function, you can defer loading heavy components, disable SSR for client-side-only features, and even show loading indicators during component fetch.</p>
    <p>Ideal for large apps, rarely used components, or third-party libraries, code splitting ensures a faster, scalable, and more user-friendly web experience.</p>

    <p>In Next.js 14, canonical links signal the preferred URL for pages with similar or duplicate content, consolidating page authority and avoiding penalties. Alternate links use the <code>hreflang</code> attribute to guide users to language- or region-specific pages, improving user experience and SEO.</p>
