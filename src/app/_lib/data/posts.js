    <h2>Why Do We Need Metadata?</h2>
    
     <p>Adding metadata to your website is crucial for visibility and engagement. It helps search engines and social media accurately represent your content and enhances user experience. Optimizing your metadata can lead to increased traffic and a stronger online presence.</p>
    <p><strong>Title and Description:</strong> Specifying these helps search engines understand your page and display it properly in search results, influencing click-through rates.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Including relevant keywords helps improve your page's ranking for those terms.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Enhances Social Media Sharing</h3>
    <p><strong>Open Graph Tags:</strong> Used by platforms like Facebook to control how your page looks when sharedâ€”title, description, and image.</p>
    <p><strong>Twitter Cards:</strong> Similar to Open Graph tags but for Twitter, enabling rich media experiences when your page is shared.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Better User Experience</h3>
    <p><strong>Consistent Branding:</strong> Metadata ensures your brand is presented consistently across platforms, building recognition and trust.</p>
    <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Including image descriptions improves accessibility for users with disabilities.</p>
